# Python_challenge
## Data Analysis on PyBank and PyPoll (PyPoll-> Resources in it (!) election_data1.cvs file is reduced data for reinning test. original large file coul not uploaded into github. (!!!)
Scripted by Python:
 ### This project has 2 parts. 
  #### Part1:
      Part1 is in Folder named PyBank. 
      PyBank has two sub Folders:
          PyBank_Challenge: main.py and output text file financial_analysis.txt files are in it.
          Resources: budget_data.csv file in it.  
      
      I am including screenshot as a reference.
      Screenshot below includes: 
        1. Instruction and given output
        2. Source code
        3. Output in the terminal
        4. budget_data.csv file
        5. financial_output.txt (output is written and open show in VS code)

 #### Part2:
      Part2 is in Folder named PyPoll. 
      PyPoll Folder intended to have 2 sub Folders, but my Resources Folder that holds election_data.csv  did not uploaded into github;
      therefore, I made assumption that data file was extremely large:
          (Directory intended organization is shown below)
          PyPoll_challenge: main.py and output text file election_result.txt files are in it.
          Resources: election_data.csv and election data1.csv files are in it.  
      
      I am including screenshot below as a reference  on small test file how my main.py run.  
    ### Part2 Folder 
    PyPoll is election data was very large to keep runnig test, therfore, I creaded election_data1.csv file has only 20 rows inlcuding header; therefore, data is only 19 rows and it was small and convenient enough to run test. So I included the screen shot for test run as well.
