# Python_challenge
## Data Analysis on PyBank and PyPoll (PyPoll-> Resources in it (!!!) election_data1.cvs file is reduced data for testing purpose)
Scripted by Python:
 ### This project has 2 parts. 
  #### Part1:
      Part1 is in Folder named PyBank. 
      PyBank has two sub Folders:
          PyBank_Challenge: main.py and output text file financial_analysis.txt files are in it.
          Resources: budget_data.csv file in it.  
      
      I am include screenshot as reference as well.

 #### Part2:
      Part2 is in Folder named PyPoll. 
      PyPoll Folder intended to have 2 sub Folders, but my Resources Folder that holds election_data.csv  did not uploaded into github;
      therefore, I made assumption that data file was extremely large:
          (Directory intended organization is shown below)
          PyPoll_challenge: main.py and output text file election_result.txt files are in it.
          Resources: election_data.csv and election data1.csv files are in it.  
      
      I am including screenshot below as a reference  on small test file how my main.py run.  
    ### Part2 Folder 
    PyPoll is election data was very large to keep runnig test, therfore, I creaded election_data1.csv file has only 20 rows inlcuding header; therefore, data is only 19 rows and it was small and convenient enough to run test. So I included the screen shot for test run as well.

   #### Part2 PyPoll_challenge run on given large data file election_data.csv 
   
   I am including below screen shot as refernce how my main.py run on given large election-data.csv. Screenshot includes:
    o instruction and expected output
    o main.py/source code
    o output in terminal
