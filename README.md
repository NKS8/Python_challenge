## Data Analysis on PyBank and PyPoll
Scripted by Python:
 ### This project has 2 parts. 
  #### Part1:
      Part1 is in Folder named PyBank. 
      PyBank has two sub Folders:
          PyBank_Challenge: main.py and output text file financial_analysis.txt files are in it.
          Resources: budget_data.csv file in it.

 #### Part2:
      Part2 is in Folder named PyPoll. 
      PyPoll suppose to have 2 sub Folders as well, but my resources Folder tha holds electiondata did not uploaded even couple try;
      therefore, I made assumption data file was ectremely large:
          (Directory intended organization showsn as below)
          PyPoll_challenge: main.py and output text file election_result.txt files are in it.
          Resources: election_data.csv and election data1.csv files are in it.  
      
      I am include screenshot as reference as well.  
    ### Part2 Folder 
    PyPoll is election data was very large to keep runnig test, therfore, I creaded election_data1.csv file hasa only 20 rows inlcuding header; therefore, data is only 19 rows and it was small and convenient to run test. So I included the screen shot for test run as well.
